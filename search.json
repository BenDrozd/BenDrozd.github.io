    "text": "March is the most exciting time of year for many basketball fans for one reason and one reason only: March Madness.\nThe crazy upsets, the Cinderella runs and the win-or-go-home situation every game make it a must-watch. However, all those things can make it tricky trying to pick a national champion for your bracket.\nTo make it easier, let’s take a look at some trends among past national champions according to KenPom data. KenPom for over 20 years has produced adjusted efficiencies for every Division 1 men’s basketball team.\nWe’ll first look at how important being good on both ends of the floor is. Here’s a look at the offensive and defensive efficiencies of every college basketball team from the past 20 years and where the last 20 national champions stand in comparison.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nkenpom2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"KemPom Rankings - 2024.csv\") |&gt;

A team that isn’t as good on defense finds themselves struggling to stop the top offenses, while teams that aren’t as strong on offense can’t keep up with the elite offenses. But how important is it to do that against tough competition during the regular season?\nUsing the same KenPom data, we’ll look at every team’s strength of schedule rating and where it ranked during that year for every team over the past 20 years.\n\n\nCode\nkenpomsos &lt;- kenpom |&gt; \n  filter(SOSAdjEM &gt; -50)\nbaylor &lt;- kenpom2021 |&gt; \n  filter(TeamSeason == \"Baylor 2021\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=kenpomsos,\n    aes(x=SOSAdjEM, y=SOSAdjEmRank),\n    color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=champions,\n    aes(x=SOSAdjEM, y=SOSAdjEmRank),\n    color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=baylor, \n    aes(x=SOSAdjEM, y=SOSAdjEmRank, label=TeamSeason),\n    nudge_y = 25\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"SOS Rating\", \n    y=\"SOS Rank\", \n    title=\"Tough Competition Matters\", \n    subtitle=\"The last 20 national champions had similar strength of schedules compared to every other team.\", \n    caption=\"Source: KenPom | By Ben Drozd\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, all the national champions find themselves close together, with one real outlier, 2021 Baylor. They are on a line with all of the other teams during the 2021 season that had much higher strength of schedule ratings. Of the past twenty national champions, Baylor had the worst strength of schedule ranking, but the highest strength of schedule rating. The only other national champion outside of the top 30 was Florida in 2007.\n\n\nCode\nchampions |&gt; \n  select(TeamSeason, SOSAdjEmRank, SOSAdjEM) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    TeamSeason = \"Team\",\n    SOSAdjEmRank = \"Rank\",\n    SOSAdjEM = \"Rating\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Comparing National Champion's Strength Of Schedule\",\n    subtitle = \"18 of the past 20 tournament winners had a top 30 strength of schedule, with 2007 Florida and 2021 Baylor being outliers.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Ben Drozd  |  **Source:** KenPom\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"black\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamSeason == \"Baylor 2021\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"black\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamSeason == \"Florida 2007\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing National Champion's Strength Of Schedule\n\n\n18 of the past 20 tournament winners had a top 30 strength of schedule, with 2007 Florida and 2021 Baylor being outliers.\n\n\nTeam\nRank\nRating\n\n\n\n\nConnecticut 2024\n26\n11.34\n\n\nConnecticut 2023\n17\n10.39\n\n\nKansas 2022\n1\n12.60\n\n\nBaylor 2021\n54\n13.25\n\n\nVirginia 2019\n22\n11.18\n\n\nVillanova 2018\n6\n11.31\n\n\nNorth Carolina 2017\n6\n12.49\n\n\nVillanova 2016\n13\n10.74\n\n\nDuke 2015\n3\n11.17\n\n\nConnecticut 2014\n13\n9.43\n\n\nLouisville 2013\n7\n10.23\n\n\nKentucky 2012\n26\n7.99\n\n\nConnecticut 2011\n2\n12.78\n\n\nDuke 2010\n4\n11.53\n\n\nNorth Carolina 2009\n24\n9.91\n\n\nKansas 2008\n14\n9.57\n\n\nFlorida 2007\n33\n8.73\n\n\nFlorida 2006\n24\n8.35\n\n\nNorth Carolina 2005\n2\n11.64\n\n\nConnecticut 2004\n18\n8.93\n\n\n\nBy: Ben Drozd | Source: KenPom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, how accurate is KenPom’s rankings of the top teams?\nSince 2004, only two teams have won that were ranked outside of the top three.
